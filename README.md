# Password Generator Starter Code
Created a random password generator, where the user gets to pick what they would like in their password.
I did this by first creating an array of characters, and then created prompts for those characters. So the user can decided which characters they would like to choose.
The first prompt asks the user how many characters are wanted, and created if statements to make sure the user inserts the correct response.
I then created prompts to ask the user which characters are wanted. I did this by creating funcitons for each character. The values of the prompt functions were then assigned into a new varaible. The new variables were created to create if statements, where character arrays were called to be concated after each prompt if user picked true. If user picked true the arrays would be concated and then suffled, joined and split. Resulting in a random password. If user picked false it would lead to an alert to try again or to come back when ready.
